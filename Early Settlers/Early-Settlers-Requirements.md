# What is Early Settlers?
## Background
"Early Settlers" is one of several "special collections" maintained by the Archives. According to the Maryland State Archives Guide to Special Collections, "The Special Collections Department, started in 1935, supervises the care, preservation, accessioning, and description of non-state agency generated records (see Code State Government Article, sec. 9-1010). These records are acquired as gifts or deposits by private donors and generally consist of personal letters, diaries, organizational records, newspapers, photographs, maps, and documents. The department also manages the State battle flag collection."

The Index to Early Settlers is a website created and maintained by the Maryland State Archives, intended to allow members of the public to look up early settlers of Maryland by name and other information.

# The Early Settlers Project
"Early Settlers" is the "starter" project that all MSA interns are given. It works with a backup/dummy database and is intended to be a means of getting new interns acquainted with Visual Basic .NET, Visual Studio, and ASPX webpages, as well as the general structure of the internship and code guidelines and expectations at the Archives.

The project given to interns is broken down into two sections: the application, and the ASPX page.
## The Application
The first part of the project is building a Windows Form Application, using the 4.8 .NET Framework, designed to allow Archives staff to access and edit the Early Settlers database.
